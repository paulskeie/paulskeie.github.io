## Paul Skeie on weather, ai, tech and science

We live in exciting times.  Getting important things done is easier than ever before as algorithms, their implementations in software and the hardware to run them is improving every month.  In meteorology physical models have improved so that over Europe the seven day forecast in 2015 was as good as the 5 day forecast in 1995.  Over the last five years, deep neural networks have shown great success as well.  In applications like feature recognition in images and speech recognition deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks beats other models by great margins.  Overfitting that used to be a huge problem is now a much smaller challenge due to improved regularization algorithms like dropout and batch normalization.  Now we can train millions of parameters on graphical processing units (GPU) with 3600 compute cores, and we can handle inputs like observations, satellite images, radar images and NWP data and branch them all into the same neural network thanks to deep learning frameworks like tensorflow, theano, torch and CNTK.  We can try things that were unthinkable and impossible just a few years ago.  Indeed, we live in exciting times.
